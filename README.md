## Description

    *   Design a calculator using the appropriate:
        +   logic
        +   data structures
        +   algorithms
    *   The program should take a string as input and evaluate it to a float

## Program
    
    *   Entry Point: Main.cpp

## Pre-requisites

    *   Intermediate knowledge of C, C++ and pointers (i.e. *ptr)
    *   Basic understanding of graph theory
    *   Basic understanding of data structures & algorithms
    *   One should also have some understanding of Reverse Polish Notation for Mathematical expressions

## Comments

    *   The operators available (+, -, *, /, ^) are by no means exhaustive
    *   This is my original method: it is neither the most time efficient nor space efficient way
    *   Common data-structure libraries were used, such as `vector` and `set`
